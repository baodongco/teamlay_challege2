// run test coverage using istanbul ! 
// istanbul assumes that the _mocha you specify translates to a JS file which is true in non-windows environments. In a windows environment, this is likely a batch file that is getting loaded by node and, of course, fails.
$ istanbul cover node_modules/mocha/bin/_mocha -- -R spec

// install global mocha and istanbul
$ npm install -g mocha
$ npm install -g istanbul
